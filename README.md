# QatarWorldcupPrediction

Me and my partner predicted the result of the Qatar World Cup using polynomial regression from ML.

The winner of the WorldCup was predicted to be France.
However, the real result of the Qatar WorldCup winner ended to be Argentina, which was quite far from our prediction.
Because of some limitations such as lack of data and usage of old fashioned AI techniques, we only could enhance the predict accuracy to 55%.
We concluded that sports results can always change so much, and that surely is the reason people go crazy with sports.
